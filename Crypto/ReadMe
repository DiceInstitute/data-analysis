We're trying to analyse ETH, DOGE, BITCOIN and EOS coins. Price prediction of Crypto Currency.

Anybody can contribute. Used the simple library prophet for time series analysis.

Expectations from the contributors:
1. What else we can use to predict more accurately.
2. What are the things better here and what are the missing things.
3. How to use other stock market processes here.
4. How to export or show the predicted price here as text format not in the graph.
